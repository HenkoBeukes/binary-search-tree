# Self-balancing BinarySearchTree
This advanced data structure takes nodes consisting of tuples of key value pairs and place it in the tree according to the binary model. 
The tree structure provides full CRUD functionality and a basic visualization. 
The tree can be saved as a pickle and saved trees can be retrieved and manipulated. 
During insertion or deletion the tree is balanced around individual nodes and around the root node. The result is a tree which is fully balanced around the central node. This makes the search and traverse of the tree very efficient.
